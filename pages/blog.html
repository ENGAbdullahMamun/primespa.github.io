          <p>Laser hair removal is an effective medical procedure using concentrated beams of light to remove unwanted body hair. While it can’t permanently stop hair from growing, it can slow it down considerably so that you can enjoy smooth, hair-free skin that lasts for several months at a time

As technology has developed to be more sophisticated, the effectiveness and safety of laser hair removal has improved massively. However, if you’re still concerned about how safe laser hair removal actually is, we’ve created a helpful breakdown of this issue. After all, safety is always an important consideration when choosing your health and beauty treatments.



HOW SAFE IS LASER HAIR REMOVAL?


In general, this method poses minimal risk to your health and the likelihood of any dangerous side-effects is very low. The majority of people who use this treatment will tell you that they experienced zero complications afterwards and that the results were fast and lasting.
<span id="1" style="display: none">
<br>
<br>
<strong>Having said this,</strong> it is not unheard of that laser hair removal can cause certain adverse side effects, which we will explore below. The biggest risk to remember from the outset, however, is with using a non-qualified practitioner.
<br>
<br>
Many stories you may hear about the dangers of laser hair removal will likely stem from untrained individuals who have not used the laser hair removal machines as they should. So make sure you always deal with experts in the field when it comes to achieving your beauty goals.
<br>
<br>


POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
 <br>
<br>

As laser hair removal targets hair follicles with concentrated light beams, your body may react with redness or slight irritation. A feeling of tenderness may also be felt as well as a tingling sensation. You may not feel anything at all, but if you do, it’s completely natural.
<br>
<br>
These symptoms are usually short-lived and the targeted area may appear in a similar way to skin after it has recently been waxed. Ice packs or cooling gels can be applied to the area to speed up your skins the recovery time.
<br>
<br>
Lasting issues may arise if your skin is scratched, rubbed or irritated in some way by your clothing. To avoid this, take care with your after treatment routine and apply moisturiser or take a cold bath if you feel your skin is overheating.

 <br>
<br>

AVOIDING INFECTION

<br>
<br>
Similar to other hair removal methods such as shaving or waxing, damaging hair follicles could lead to an infection. This is unlikely to happen however, if you take care of your skin and avoid touching the area with dirty hands after the treatment.
<br>
<br>
For those who do experience an infection from laser hair removal, it’s important to treat it like you would a cut. Don’t expose it to any harmful substances and leave it to heal on its own before undergoing any future treatments.
<br>
<br>
Scarring, which is perhaps the biggest fear of many people who undertake laser hair removal, won’t occur as long as you receive the treatment from a qualified practitioner who will be able to review you skin type and the course of necessary treatments required for you to achieve the best results.

 <br>
<br>

PROTECT YOUR EYES DURING LASER HAIR REMOVAL

<br>
<br>
The hair removal procedure uses powerful lasers to deliver its results. As such, there is a risk of serious eye injury if the machine is accidentally applied to your eyes. This may occur if you are removing hair from your upper lip or other parts of your face for instance. To avoid this, always wear the protective goggles provided by your beauty technician.

          <p>A great Christmas gift is one that lasts. Far better than a predictable item of clothing or an unimaginative gift card, a facial treatment is a wonderful gift that keeps on giving as the winter weather starts to take a serious toll on our skin.<br>
The winter months present a whole host of challenges. From the harsh drying effects of central heating, to the colder winds that become more blustery and frequent, often people may find that their skin is more delicate during this time of year.
<br>

<span id="2" style="display: none">
    <strong>By ensuring that</strong> you take extra care of your skin during winter, you can help your skin’s natural glow to shine through. And if you’re stuck for a Christmas present, then the gift of a fortifying and enjoyable facial treatment may be the perfect treat for someone special!
<br>
<br>
MAKE WINTER LESS HARSH
 <br>
<br>

The blustering cold winds of winter can be awful for your skin in many ways. And as the humidity levels drop, your skin is likely to suffer from the lack of moisture in the air and experience dryness and flakiness more frequently as a result. This also makes skin more vulnerable to harsh winds.
<br>
<br>
For men and women of all ages and skin types, winter can cause damage to your skin and intensify any skin conditions you might already have. One of the best remedies for this is a facial treatment that identifies your skin’s needs and works with it to restore its natural balance.

 <br>
<br>

RESTORE DEHYDRATED SKIN
 <br>
<br>

Winter is also a time where people turn up their heating to the max and take long hot showers and baths to relax after facing the cold during the day. While it’s hard to argue with the soothing and calming benefits of an indulgent hot shower or bath, if you don’t take special care, it can actually be quite damaging for your skin causing dehydration and dryness.
<br>
<br>
As well as humidifiers and using slightly stronger moisturisers that can help to combat these effects, one of the best ways to keep your skin hydrated during winter is to book in for a facial treatment from a beauty expert who understands the science behind good skin.
<br>
<br>


HELP WITH YOUR HOLIDAY HABITS

<br>
<br>
For many people, the holiday season comes hand in hand with some unfortunate bad habits. A time when comfort eating, lack of exercise and large, carb-heavy meals are plentiful, this all has an impact on your skin.
<br>
<br>
Of course, we’re not saying you should deny yourself your Christmas treats, but it is well worth remembering how certain foods such as sugary snacks, salty party foods and increased alcohol consumption could lead to more winter break-outs.
<br>
<br>
As well as keeping an eye on your overall diet and skin health, a great way to remedy the effects of your winter lifestyle is to undergo a rejuvenating facial treatment to balance out your skin’s oil levels and to detoxify your skin cells from unwanted toxins.
<br>
<br>

      <h1 class="my-4" style="font-weight: 700;">IS LASER HAIR REMOVAL WORTH IT?

          <h3 class="my-3">Description</h3>
          <p>Laser hair removal is an effective medical procedure that uses concentrated beams of light to remove unwanted body hair.

While this might not be your first method of choice, results have shown that it’s a highly sustainable way of achieving smoother skin. So much so, that thousands of women and men have traded their usual waxing or shaving routines for less frequent laser hair removal treatments.

The biggest barrier for people considering laser hair removal is still their lack of knowledge about what the process actually entails and whether it’s worth it. Let’s take a look at some of the important considerations for those contemplating a new tool in their beauty regime this winter.
<br>

<span id="3" style="display: none">
    <strong>HOW FAST</strong> CAN I EXPECT RESULTS?
 <br>
 <br>

Hairs may not fall out immediately, but you will gradually see a decrease over a period of days and weeks. And as your treatment plan continues, you will witness less hair growth in the targeted area.
<br>
<br>
Repeated treatments are usually necessary to ensure lasting hair removal. While the results will vary depending on your skin and hair type, as well as your beauty goals and how much of your body you are targeting with laser hair removal, you can expect to receive several different treatments over a course of weeks or months for the best effects.

 <br>
 <br>

HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?

<br>
<br>
Laser hair removal doesn’t completely stop hair growth, but it will slow it down to a rate that you won’t have to shave, wax or apply hair removal cream anytime soon.
<br>
<br>
If you want to achieve long-term removal over a number of years, you can arrange to have maintenance treatments that top up the effects of the initial treatment.
<br>
<br>
Some have experienced hair-free skin for several months following only minimal treatments, while others have noticed regrowth happen at a sooner rate. But all this depends on your treatment plan of choice, your type of hair and your hair removal goals. We’ll explain everything when you arrive!
<br>
<br>


IS IT WORTH IT?

<br>
<br>
The main motivation to use laser hair removal treatments is to save time and discomfort from your weekly (or daily) hair removal regime. By considerably slowing down the growth of new hairs and removing hair from awkward or inconvenient places, you can enjoy the freedom of lovely smooth skin throughout the year.
<br>
<br>
It’s true that laser hair removal treatment plans are not as cheap as other hair removal options, but if you see it as an investment over a longer period of time, it may well be worth the cost.

 <br>
 <br>

You don’t need to rush your decision. Come and talk to us and we’ll be happy to explain everything in more detail. You can visit Primas Medispa for a free consultation and we’ll happily advise you about the best treatment plan for your hair and skin type.

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <h3 class="my-3">Description</h3>
          <p>You might have an elaborate home skin care routine that helps you maintain healthy and clean looking skin, but sometimes it’s best to let the professionals take care of you every once in a while.

 <br>
 <br>

Far from a frivolous treatment that you could do yourself at home, a quality facial will actually identify the unique qualities of your skin – whether it is dry, sensitive, oily, normal – before implementing the most suitable treatment to bring out the best in your skin and help you glow.

 <br>
 <br>

Many people underestimate the impact that pollution, hormones, stress and other unavoidable elements can have on the health of your skin. An amazing facial can be the best way to fight off damage and signs of ageing and keep you looking fresh all year round.

<span id="5" style="display: none">
<b>EXPRESS FACIAL</b>
Sometimes it’s hard to carve out enough time from your busy schedule to take care of your skin health. Our express facial is designed to give our clients the best possible treatment in only 30 mins. Whether you’re on your lunch break or passing by on your way home, the express facial will clean, exfoliate and deeply cleanse your skin through a personalised mask.
<br>
<br>
<b>DEEP HYDRATION</b>
One of the most common issues with skin is dehydration and lack of moisture. Rather than applying vast amounts of moisture on yourself each night, a deep hydration facial may be the best way to replenish your moisture balance and recover tired and stressed looking skin. This will help to reduce fine lines, soften your complexion and reduce the size of pores.

 <br>
 <br>

<b>ACNE AND ANTI-BLEMISH</b>
This is where our experienced knowledge as professional beauticians really comes into effect. By identifying your type of acne or skin condition, we can offer you the most suitable facial treatment that will help to reduce any uncontrolled breakouts, blemishes or blackheads. Usually it is a simple case of identifying the problem and restoring balance to your oil and moisture levels.

 <br>
 <br>

<b>DEEP CLEANSE</b>
If you’re looking for a full skin detox, our deep cleanse facial will be the best option for you. Reducing breakouts, clearing congested pores and generally achieving a fresher, cleaner look all starts with a deep cleanse. We use a special anti-blemish activator to steam and exfoliate away dead skin cells, bacteria and debris to let you reach optimal PH balance and benefit from clean, hydrated and smooth skin.

 <br>
 <br>

<b>COLLAGEN ANTI-AGEING TREATMENT</b>
This treatment is designed to give you a firmer and more youthful appearance, restoring your skin’s elasticity and reducing the appearance of sagging skin. To do this, we use a combination of ingredients such as Vitamin C, plant extracts and other various antioxidant-rich elements to treat your face, eyes, lips and neck.

 <br>
 <br>

<b>UNDERSTANDING YOUR SKIN</b>
At Primas Medispa we’ll do more than just give you a quick facial and send you on your way. Our job is to understand the unique character of your skin and body and help you achieve your overall beauty goals.
<br>
<br>
If you want some honest advice from a friendly team of trained beauticians and medical staff, then we’re here to help you. From comprehensive body contouring packages to express facials, we’ll be glad to help design a tailor made package for you. Simply drop by the spa or give us a call and we’ll have you looking your best self in no time.</span>

      <h1 class="my-4" style="font-weight: 700;">THE AMAZING T-SHAPE TREATMENT

      </h1>
 <p style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">By stephen | September 20, 2018 | </p>

          <h3 class="my-3">Description</h3>
          <p>If you’re looking for a true transformation, the amazing T-shape treatment could be the perfect solution. Using advanced technology that combines three proven methods of revealing beautiful skin while removing stubborn fat and cellulite, this might be your key to unlocking those much desired beauty goals.
<br>

<span id="6" style="display: none">
    <b>WHAT IS THE T-SHAPE TREATMENT?</b>
 <br>
 <br>

The T-shape treatment is designed especially for the removal of stubborn fat as well as the overall contouring of the body to reveal naturally beautiful form.
<br>
<br>
It is one of the only non-invasive methods for full body remodelling that can simultaneously remove unwanted body mass while tightening and lifting skin.
<br>
<br>
Although it has the potential to produce large scale transformations, it can also be targeted to treat small problem areas such as the upper arms, thighs, hips or abdomen – so it’s worth considering as an option whatever your specific beauty goals might be.
<br>
<br>
      <b>RADIOFREQUENCY</b>
 <br>
 <br>

Multi-polar radio frequency is a revolutionary skin rejuvenation treatment that can achieve instant results without surgery or unnecessary pain. It has been designed to combat the effects of aging by reducing fine lines, lifting and tightening the skin, and reducing cellulite.
<br>
<br>
As you age, your skin will naturally lose some of its elasticity in certain areas of your body. This treatment targets these areas by selectively applying heat to stimulate skin tissues and collagen fibres to reveal smoother and younger looking skin.
<br>
<br>
    <b>VACUUM MASSAGE</b>

<br>
<br>
The vacuum massage is a popular anti-cellulite treatment method that aims to prevent and decrease the accumulation of cellulite deposits. It does this by stimulating the lymphatic system and encouraging the flow of certain fluids.

Used both as a medical treatment for certain health issues as well as a beauty solution, vacuum massages can be a great way to achieve greater elasticity for your skin while allowing you to achieve your overall body contouring goals.


<br>
<br>
    <b>LTTT TREATMENT</b>
<br>
<br>

Low level laser therapy (LLLT) refers to the use of light for altering the biological activity of certain target areas of the body. Specific wavelengths are used to effectively stimulate tissues in the body resulting in tissue repair, wound healing and the maintenance of skin cells.
<br>
<br>
LLLT is often used as a treatment to alleviate the visible effects of aging by reducing skin wrinkles, fine lines, saggy skin and dryness that can be a result of sun exposure, diet or simply the natural effects of time.
<br>
<br>
    <b>WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?</b>
 <br>
 <br>

The amazing T-shape treatment can be used to reveal firmer and younger looking skin that will accentuate the natural curves of your body. It does this by removing unwanted body mass and reducing the prominence of saggy skin and wrinkles.
<br>
<br>
Together with the accelerated removal of cellulite, your body can be transformed to reveal stunning and lasting results.
<br>
<br>
After your procedure, results can be witnessed almost immediately, proving the T-shape treatment to be an effective and speedy solution for people hoping to achieve their ultimate beauty goals without heavy surgery.

 <br>
 <br>

      <h1 class="my-4" style="font-weight: 700;">TARGETING STUBBORN BODY PARTS WITH CRYO FAT FREEZING

      </h1>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <h3 class="my-3">Description</h3>
          <p>Cryo fat freezing, sometimes referred to as ‘cool sculpting’, is a method of improving the natural contours of your body through targeted temperature treatments.

While it has been discussed widely within fitness, health and beauty circles recently, many people still don’t know exactly what it is and how it can help you.

This method of body contouring actually has a charming history – or so the rumour goes. Apparently, doctors once noticed that children who ate popsicles experienced fat reduction in their cheeks, sometimes leading to dimples.

Even if you don’t believe that this alluring story was the origin of the today’s Cryo Fat Freezing treatments, it is true that extremely cold temperatures targeted at specific areas of the body can result in fat reduction.
<span id="7" style="display: none">
    <b>Why choose Cryo Fat Freezing</b>

<br>
<br>

Sometimes there are simply parts of the body that are hard to trim down, no matter how many miles you run each morning. Even for fitness enthusiasts and those who regularly partake in sporting activities, the natural shape of your body can create unwanted areas of excess weight.
<br>
<br>
Cryo Fat Freezing allows you to specifically eliminate stubborn areas of your body that prevent you from achieving your ultimate beauty and physique goals.

 <br>
 <br>

        <b>How does it work?</b>




<br>
<br>
Cry Fat Freezing uses focused cooling to target fat cells in areas of the body that are difficult to burn with natural exercise and dieting. Over the duration of your treatments, your body will naturally process these frozen cells and remove them from your body.
<br>
<br>
These cells gradually filtrate from the body through natural processes, resulting in a slimmer and more shapely body. As this happens, areas that are not directly targeted will not be affected, so you don’t have to worry about losing overall body weight in places that you want to keep it.

 <br>
 <br>

    <b>The results</b>


<br>
<br>
This method of treatment reduces excessive body fat and restores your natural shape. Depending on your goals, you can expect a reduced waistline and less bulging in areas of your body that are typically hard to eliminate.
<br>
<br>
The important thing to remember with this treatment is that it is not designed to reduce huge amounts of excessive weight. It is made for mild shaping and toning of your body.
<br>
<br>
While the weight you lose through this treatment will not return on its own, you may gain additional weight in these targeted areas due to a high fat diet or lack of exercise.
<br>
<br>
Cryo Fat Freezing should be treated as a mild and helpful technique that you can use together with exercise and a balanced diet. Unlike other forms of body contouring that may involve invasive surgery or chemical treatments, it will not permanently transform your body.

 <br>
 <br>

    <b>Is it for you?</b>


<br>
<br>
This treatment is recommended for individuals who already have slender body shapes, but just need some extra help to achieve their ultimate body goals.
<br>
<br>
You shouldn’t see Cryo Fat Freezing as an alternative to exercise and a healthy diet, but simply a way to finish off your good work and keep you looking at your very best.
<br>
<br>
This is a perfect method for those who don’t want to use aggressive technology or treatments, but want to mildly improve their body’s curves and contours to create a naturally pleasing shape.

          <h3 class="my-3">Description</h3>
          <p>Hair always grows back. That’s a fact. No matter how often you shave, it always returns, bringing with it unwanted itching and bad ingrowths. While waxing can be more effective, it’s an extreme method that pulls away the protective layer of your skin along with your hair, causing irritation in addition to the sharp sting!



Cream that removes hair may seem like a more gentle option, but this is far from the truth. Skin irritation, allergic reactions, lingering smells and chemical burns are the side effects of certain depilatory creams. So what’s the solution?



While people associate laser hair removal treatments with pain, high cost and a humorous collection of bizarre side effects, it can actually be the best option to help you achieve healthy, smooth and hairless skin.



To illustrate this, we’ve gathered some of the most popular myths about the treatment in order to offer you some well needed hair removal education.
<span id="9" style="display: none">
    <b>THE TREATMENT IS TOO EXPENSIVE</b>
 <br>
 <br>

It’s true that treatments for laser hair removal are more expensive than waxing or shaving products, but to simply end the conversation there would be short-sighted. The best way to view the cost effectiveness of this treatment is to weigh the price against the duration of its effects and the ability to avoid constant itching and irritation – not to mention the endless hours you accumulate waxing or shaving.

 <br>
 <br>

The number of trips to the parlour is small in comparison to the amount of times you will need to buy alternative hair removal products. Scheduling your treatments over a number of months or a year will ensure that you never have to worry about hair removal issues in the short term.

 <br>
 <br>

Also, the areas that you want to target are probably very small, such as your eyebrows or the upper lip, rather than large sections of skin. These treatments are relatively inexpensive if you consider how the cost is spread out over a year, you will start to see it’s really not that expensive.

<br>
<br>

       <b>ASER HAIR REMOVAL IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL</b>

<br>
<br>
This myth originates from the very first machines that were used for laser hair removal. When the technology first came out, it was known to cause damage to skin. Today the technology is much more advanced.

 <br>
 <br>

Some patients may feel a prickling or tingling sensation that causes moderate discomfort, but compared to the momentary pain caused by waxing, it really doesn’t compare.

 <br>
 <br>

With modern machines, discomfort is kept to a minimal and if you are particularly sensitive, you can even use a numbing cream. But this is usually unnecessary. Long term side effects are a thing of the past!
<br>
<br>


    <b>T ONLY WORKS ON CERTAIN HAIR TYPES</b>

<br>
<br>
Laser hair removal works on all hair types, however in the past technology was not as effective at removing lighter hair types such as ginger. Things have changed a lot in the industry over the years and laser hair removal treatment has become much more effective at combating all hair types including ginger, blonde and other light hair shades.

 <br>
 <br>

Having said this, the best results can still be seen on darker hair colours. It will sometimes take an additional number of sessions to get the same results for lighter hair colours, but the effects can still be substantial so consult with your doctor what is required for your hair type.

 <br>
 <br>

    <b>HE TREATMENT ACTUALLY CAUSES MORE HAIR TO GROW</b>
 <br>
 <br>

Laser Hair Removal doesn’t cause increased hair growth rates or even denser hair growth. Each treatment should in fact cause a significant decrease of hair growth. This translates to the speed of growth as well as the density and thickness of the actual hair strands.

 <br>
 <br>

When hair eventually grows back after your treatment phases has ended, you hair will typically be much lighter and finer – so even if you stop your treatments completely, the areas you found to be the most troublesome in the past will be easier to manage.

 <br>
 <br>

    <b>ASER HAIR REMOVAL DOESN’T WORK ON DARK SKIN</b>

<br>
<br>
At one point, this myth was actually true. Unfortunately, the technology of the past was not effective in treating darker skinned patients. This is because it is the melanin in the skin that is targeted to achieve the desired effect.

<br>
<br>

Modern technology has long been able to successfully remove hair on darker skin though, so if you’re complexion is what has stopped you from receiving treatment, you should reconsider.
<br>
<br>


When consulting with a professional, feel free to raise this concern, and they should be able to offer you any assurances that you need regarding this issue.

          <h3 class="my-3">Description</h3>
          <p>At Primas Medispa, we know how hard it is to eliminate stubborn areas of fat and excess skin – especially as it gets closer to summer, and the pressure to look your best increases. Sometimes, no matter how much cardio work you do in the park, or how many yoga sessions you book at the studio – it’s just not enough to transform those difficult areas of your body.

 <br>

Luckily, various body contouring methods allow you to harness the wonders of science to boost your natural appearance and beauty, targeting the most troublesome areas of the body to leave you looking your best.


<br>
With today’s technology and scientific advancements in the field of medical beauty treatments, there are many types of body contouring methods available. But the perfect treatment for you will always depend on your body shape, goals and overall preferences.
<br>


When deciding what is best for you, make sure you seek advice from a reputable centre with professional and caring beauticians who can design the optimal personal treatment plan for you.
<span id="10" style="display: none">
  <b> THE AMAZING T-SHAPE TREATMENT

<br>
<br>
The T-shape treatment, which includes the combined power of Radiofrequency, Laser LTT and vacuum treatment at the same time, is one of the most effective treatments in the market today. This is down to its ability to reveal more firm, smooth and toned skin over your body’s natural curves.
<br>
<br>


Cellulite and stubborn fat is incredibly difficult to remove from certain areas of your body, including your thighs and lower back, which leaves many people feeling frustrated, even if they’ve dedicated many early hours of each morning to the treadmill. T-shape acts as a final solution to these problems, targeting both small and large areas across the whole body.
<br>
<br>


      <b>CRYO FAT FREEZING</b>
 <br>
 <br>

Another effective method on the market is Cryo Fat Freezing, a great way to destroy fat cells by freezing them. Though fewer people know about the benefits of this method, it nonetheless has some amazing potential to contour and tighten the body to achieve your desired look.

<br>
<br>

This method is great for people who don’t want to undertake invasive surgery and simply want to target troublesome areas of their body, whether this is the upper arms, thighs, hips or abdomen. It works by applying isolated temperatures to locations of the body in order to reduce fat and cellulite cells, which are then drained away by your body’s lymphatic system.

 <br>
 <br>

    <b>PRESSOTHERAPY</b>
At the other end of the spectrum, Pressotheraphy uses heat to achieve its results. A creative solution that uses both science and an understanding of the body’s natural processes, this method works by applying pressure and heat to dissolve fat.

 <br>
 <br>

Infrared technology heats up cells inside the body, up to 7cm below the skin. This targets areas of stubborn fat deposits, increasing fat metabolism. Also known as the slim press, or the lymphatic massage, this treatment can be perfect for those who want to slim down this summer, and remove excess waste and toxins – all without the use of invasive surgery.

<br>
<br>

    <b>CAVITATION</b>

<br>
<br>
You might not have heard of Cavitation, as it’s a relatively new non-surgical and non-invasive fat removal procedure. But it’s gradually growing as a popular method for contouring the body and regaining former shape and form.

 <br>
 <br>

Effectively, this method uses ultrasound to produce heat vibrations that target fat cells. This creates vibrations and dissolves fat cells resulting in their eventual removal through the lymphatic urinary systems. Finally, a lymphatic massage flushes out these toxins from the body, leaving you feel restored
<br>
<br>


    <b>U-CURVE OR LIPO LASER</b>

<br>
<br>
The U-Curve or Lipo Laser treatment is the perfect option for those who want to reduce the appearance of fat with subtlety and care. With no needles, injections or invasive surgery needed, this method transmits low energy waves to penetrate the skin, making fat cells “sweat” water, glycerol and fatty acids.


<br>
<br>
Fat cells are forced to shrink and fatty liquids are removed through the lymphatic system to leave the body in better shape.  Though this is considered a mild treatment, it can still produce substantial results within weeks of treatment, with a potential visible reduction of up to 3 inches.

 <br>
